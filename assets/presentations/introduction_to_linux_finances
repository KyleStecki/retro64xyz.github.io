# Introduction To Linux Finances 

???

Today I will be introducing the concepts and tools we need to use Linux and
Free Software to help us manage our finances. Linux has numerous tools that can
be used when dealing with taxes, investments, savings, and putting all of this
information together to form a bigger picture. There are also proprietary and
closed source tools that are available as well. As it stands, the financial
world has not yet entered the free software pool completely and there are still
situations where we must deal with their decisions.

# Agenda

1. How can free software help me manage my money?
2. How do we acquire the software?
3. What are my options?
4. How do I keep track of it all?
5. Is it worth it?

???

There are five important concepts that we should cover when it comes to free
software and our finances. We need to decide if it makes sense for you to take
an interest in your financials, how you should go about doing it, and who you
should bank with. You also need to decide how you plan to keep track of it all
and if the time invested will pay dividends in the future.

# Why financial literacy?

- Comfort

	A financial cushion can help you make important decisions. You can pick and
	choose when and where you want to work in order to maximize your happiness. It
	becomes easier when you feel comfortable with your finances and have a better
	understanding of how much money you need, when, and why.

- Safety

	Loss of a job could be devestating but having strong understanding of your
	finances can help prevent a disaster. If you are able to budget, make
	decisions, and plan, it makes it much easier on you when it is time to go
	looking for a new source of income.

- Retirement

	Riterement and planning for retirement is extremely important. You need to have
	an understanding of where and when you spend your money so you can become self
	sufficient and plan out your future. Many of us have been told numerous times
	that we will not be able to rely on Social Security in the future. You need to
	build your self reliance and plan on caring for yourself in the future.

There are numerous benefits to be found when you decide to take an interest in
your own finances. It can often be cheaper, simpler, and more confidence
inspiring. You just need to make a decision about where you want to go, build a
plan, and put that plan into action.

You need to make a budget. Save money. Invest those savings. Setting small but
attainable goals can assist you in achieving larger goals down the line. Each
year you should set yourself a small goal that you feel you can achieve.

# What budget software?

2. https://www.gnucash.org/

???

I use CLI software. My budget software of choice is ledger-cli. This has the
steepest learning curve but is also the most powerful and easily controlled. You
have the option to do a lot of neat stuff using Git in combination with ledger.
