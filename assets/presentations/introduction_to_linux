# Introduction To Linux 

???

Today I will be introducing the Linux Operating System and the concepts that
make up an operating system. I will include a high level overview of what
standards come together to constitute an operating system, how an operating
system benefits the user, and what alternative Linux provides to the standard
Mac / Windows ecosystem that most users are familiar with.

# Agenda

1. What is Linux?
2. How do we acquire Linux?
3. What does Linux do?
4. What is open source software?
5. Who is using Linux?

???

There are five core concepts that I want to explore. We should discuss what
Linux is, why there are so many "flavors" or choices when it comes to Linux,
and how we should acquire Linux. We need to understand what Linux does when it
is installed on your computer and why you may want to replace an operating
system like Windows with a copy of Linux. We need to understand the concepts of
open source software. What does having a free and open standard for our OS do
for us. We must also discover just who is using Linux.

# Linux Is An Operating System

- Portable Operating System Interface

	POSIX is the name of a family of related standards specified by the IEEE to
	define the application programming interface, shell, and utilitie interfaces
	for software compatible with variants of Unix. Being POSIX compatible provides
	the user with confidance that they should have an understanding of how the OS
	functions along with the components of the OS when writing software that
	interacts with the system.

- Linux Standard Base

	LSB is a joint project by several Linux distributions to standardize software
	structure, filesystem hierarchy, and interaction with a Linux based OS. The LSB
	is based on POSIX specification, Single Unix Specification, and other open
	standards while also enhancing or extending them as necessary.

???

SUS? LSB? POSIX? The real reality is that we have generally standardized how a
system should operate and react since 2001. There are around 3700 pages,
thematically divided, that provide the definitions, conventions, and
specifications for every aspect of the operating system. This also includes a
certification and testing suite that can be used to verify compliance for your
operating system. Fee for certification can range from $2000 to $12000
depending on necessity and licensure. Few if any independnant Linux
distributions are willing to pay for certification or licensure but many do
follow the standards set forth.

# What is an operating system?

The operating system is the software that supports the basic functions of the
computer. This includes scheduling tasks, executing applications, and
controlling the peripherals installed on the computer. 

???

We need the operating system to manage the operations of all of the software
that we want to run. These are the building blocks that provide us with a
manageable and useful system. A standards compliant operating system provides
the best framework for developing software that runs across a multitude of
hardware combinations and simplifies the job of the individuals writing
software for that operating system.

# Where should I get Linux?

The most popular Linux distribution is Linux Mint with Ubuntu and Debian taking
the second and third place respectively. You can download a copy of Linux Mint
using your browser. I recommend that you view [distro
watch](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major) and make your choice
after reading about the different distributions available to you.

I recommend the following -

1. Xubuntu
2. Linux Mint
3. Ubuntu

???

The choice of Linux should come down to your choice of window manager, desktop
environment, and the package manager that you are most comfortable with. The
deb/apt style and the rpm/yum style are the two most popular package managers.
My favorite window manager is I3 and my desktop environment of choice is XFCE.

# Why propose Linux over that OS that came with my hardware?

- Cost
	- Free
- Security
	- Open Source And Regularly Patched
- Choice ( Freedom )
	- Build it how you like it

# Who is using Linux?

Developers, programmers, and people who are interested in taking control of
their computer are the most likely users of a Linux based operating system. If
you want to understand how your computer works and are interested in
contributing to the development of software, you will most likely want to use
some form of Unix or Linux variant.

# Does Linux have software?

- Email
	- Thunderbird, Geary, Mutt
- Chat
	- Pidgin, Empathy, Kopete
- Video Editing 
	- Open Shot, Pitivi, Blender
- Video Player 
	- MPV, VLC
- Music Player 
	- CMUS, MPV, VLC
- Word Processor 
	- VIM, EMACS, Open Office
- Text Editor 
	- VIM, EMACS
- IDE 
	- Codelite, Netbeans, Code::Blocks, VIM, and MORE!!!
- Web Browser 
	- Chrome, Firefox, Ice Weasel, and MORE!!!
- Gaming 
	- Steam, Desura, Good Old Games, and MORE!!!

There are plenty of tools available to you as a user if you are interested in
switching over to Linux. If you can accomplish your goal on a Windows or Mac
based system, you should have no issues doing it under Linux.
