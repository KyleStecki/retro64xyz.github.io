## Breakdown

Salt and Sanctuary is one of the best video games of 2016. It is an action
adventure game in the metroidvania style with a dark and gothic art style,
excellent audio, and fantastic game play. I recently purchased this game with
my own money and feel strongly enough about the quality of this work that I am
inclinced to review this game. I am not being compensated for my views.

This is a must-buy game if you enjoy action role playing games. The major draw
for me was the fact that the game came with native Linux support. I am playing
this game on an Intel NUC I7 and it runs flawlessly at 1080P on the integrated
graphics. It also supports the Xbox One Controller and I found that to be
absolutely plug and play. I had no issues with purchasing the game on steam,
installing it, and using my controller without configuration or hassle.

The gameplay is similar to games like Castlevania or Super Metroid with crisp
and beautiful art, haunting music, and excellent sound effects. The actual
playstyle rewards patience and intelligence. You are not strong enough to
simply beat on most of the creatures. You must use the environment, tools, and
your wits to survive in this world. Something that many gamers are probably not
used to with games like Call of Duty where you need only find cover and wait a
period of time before slogging back into battle.

Your character has finite resources and must survive or you will loose all of
your experience points (salt) and must return to defeat what ever foe fell you
before recovering. It is a fun mechanic that punishes the foolhardy and rewards
the meticulous in kind. I found the game to be the right combination of
challenging and rewarding.

There is multiplayer but I do not know another person who owns this game yet,
so I have not tried it myself.

## The Bottom Line

Do yourself a favor and add this game to your library. You owe it to yourself
to purchase an amazing game that has native Linux support.
