### The Hot Cop Was Fired

A '[Hot Cop][HotCop]' posts anti semitic things on his social media and gets
fired after previously going viral and becoming known for being 'super
sexy'.

This Florida Police Officer decided to make jokes about Hitler, Jews, and
otherwise do dumb shit on the computer. He made the comments back between
2011 and 2013 but after becoming famous, others decided to go through records
of his online history. He has since been fired.

### Esports Extortion Attempt

The [ESports Group ESEA][ESports] was the victim of a failed extortion
attempt and lost 1.5 million profiles. Data lost included addresses, logins,
names, web site urls, Steam ID, Xbox ID, and PSN IDs.

- An extortion attempt was made for a sum of $100,000

- 1.5 million accounts are at risk

- Intellectual Property was stolen as well

### Equifax Hack

[Equifax was hacked][equifaxone] and this is what happened. 
Then they [screwed up][equifaxdb] again.

- Attackers gained access to about 50% of the US Populations data
- Breach was announced
- Stocks Plummet nearly 15%
- Senior Security Executives retire (Yes, the music teacher lady)
- Equifax CEO says their sorry by penning a letter in an op-ed
- Senators start investigating
- Equifax Chief Information Officer and Chief Security Officer quit
- Equifax sends users to a bogus website accidently and funnels victims to be
  [victimized again][equifaxtwo]
- Equifax CEO retires
- Equifax says 2.5 million more people may be victims
- Equifax admits that mistakes were made

### Another Yahoo Hack

[Yahoo][YahooHack] was hacked. Again. Like again again. Not just that one
time or that other time. But yes, again.

Marissa Mayer had a [senate hearing][SenateHearing].

Yahoo got breached by 'very sophisticated hackers'. [Spear Fishing][YahooSpear].

### Shadow Brokers

[Shadow Brokers][ShadowBrokers] leaked stuff from the NSA. They probably
stole a lot of their leaks from [Harold Martin][NSAContractor]. He stole
50 Terabytes of data.

Also let's not forget [Reality Winner][RealWinner]

### WannaCry

[WannaCry happened][Wannacry].

### Petya and NotPetya

[NotPetya happened][notpetya].

### Bad Rabbit

[Bad Rabbit Malware hit][therabbit].

### GOP Voter Records Exposed

GOP voter records were [exposed][gopvoters].

### The Dark Overlord

When not stealing [Netflix stuff][xtort1] a group called 'The Dark
Overlord' decided to [extort parents and kids][xtort2] as they targeted
schools across the nation.

### Uber Scandal

Uber paid someone [$100,000][uberhack] to cover up a hack of 57 million Uber
customers.  That is called extortion. This breach may change laws as senators
are now looking to make covering up breaches a crime.

They were [hacked][uberhackprev] while dealing with a court case on their
handling of users private data.

### Vault 7 and Wikileaks

Wikileaks and [Vault 7][vault7]

### Cloudbleed

[Cloudbleed][cloudbleed]

### Political Hacking

[France Macron Leak][macronleak]

[DNC Hack][dnchacking]

[DNC Inside Job][dncinside]

[Future Of Political Hacking][politicalhacking]

### Apple Money

[Apple][applemoney] is bringing home $350 billion dollars and pledges to make
20,000 jobs within five years.

### H1B changes

[Congress][congressraise] is presenting the RAISE act.

[Foreign workers][h1bconcerns] are raising their concerns.

[India is preparing][timeofindia] for major changes in H1B.

### Conclusion

Cyber related crime is costing trillions of dollars. Companies are spending an
increasing amount of time being forced to focus on their own safety as they
discover that there is an increasing disconnect between local and state level
law enforcement and the crimes being committed.

Baltimore, Cleveland, and Madison, Wisconsin have all found their law
enforcement under attack by hackers who decided to take matters into their own
hands after poorly handled events spiraled out of control. Chief Of Police
Terry Sult of Hampton, Virginia stated that 'You can expect be hacked if you
have a questionable shooting.' and that is dangerous for the public.

### Final Recommendations

1. Read the [Cost Of Crime Study by Accenture][costofcrime].

2. Understand the [cost of poor security][securitycosts].

3. Start applying for new jobs and exploring the options. IT jobs are back on the
   menu for Americans!

4. Get involved!

5. Do I need to tell you to use Linux in 2018?
