2. New or Novel Attacks
3. Events Of Interest

## Major Events 

1. [Swatting][CallOfDutyShooting] continues to be an issue with the first known
   death from a swatting call occurring this year.

   @Swautistic, the individual who claimed responsibility to getting an unarmed
   man killed in Kansas has previously claimed to be responsible for -

   - 100+ School Threats

   - 10+ Residence Threats

   - Was previously convicted for calling in a bomb threat to an ABC affiliate

   Tyler Barris, AKA @Swautistic will have had his Extradition Proceeding Hearing
   on 02/02/2018 and his current case number is BA464000. Documents about the case
   are available from the Superior Court Of California for a cost of approximately
   $5.00. He will be charged with Manslaughter.


2. A '[Hot Cop][HotCop]' posts anti semitic things on his social media and gets
   fired after previously going viral and becoming known for being 'super
   sexy'.

   This Florida Police Officer decided to make jokes about Hitler, Jews, and
   otherwise do dumb shit on the computer. He made the comments back between
   2011 and 2013 but after becoming famous, others decided to go through records
   of his online history. He has since been fired.

3. The [ESports Group ESEA][ESports] was the victim of a failed extortion
   attempt and lost 1.5 million profiles. Data lost included addresses, logins,
   names, web site urls, Steam ID, Xbox ID, and PSN IDs.

   - An extortion attempt was made for a sum of $100,000

   - 1.5 million accounts are at risk

   - Intellectual Property was stolen as well

4. Equifax was hacked and this is what happened.

   - Attackers gained access to about 50% of the US Populations data
   - Breach was announced
   - Stocks Plummet nearly 15%
   - Senior Security Executives retire (Yes, the music teacher lady)
   - Equifax CEO says their sorry by penning a letter in an op-ed
   - Senators start investigating
   - Equifax Chief Information Officer and Chief Security Officer quit
   - Equifax sends users to a bogus website accidently and funnels victims to be
     victimized again
   - Equifax CEO retires
   - Equifax says 2.5 million more people may be victims
   - Equifax admits that mistakes were made

5. [Yahoo][YahooHacked] was hacked. Again. Like again again. Not just that one
   time or that other time. But yes, again.

   Marissa Mayer had a [senate hearing][SenateHearing].

   Yahoo got breached by 'very sophisticated hackers'. [Spear Fishing][YahooSpear].

6. [Shadow Brokers][ShadowBrokers] leaked stuff from the NSA. They probably
   stole a lot of their leaks from [Harold Martin][NSAContractor]. He stolen
   50 Terabytes of data.

   Also let's not forget [Reality Winner][RealWinner]

7. [WannaCry happened][Wannacry].

8. [NotPetya happened][notpetya].

9. [Bad Rabbit Malware hit][therabbit].

10. GOP voter records were [exposed][gopvoters].

11. When not stealing [Netflix stuff][xtort1] a group called 'The Dark
	Overlord' decided to [extort parents and kids][xtort2] as they targetted
	schools across the nation.


12. Uber paid someone $100,000 to cover up a hack of 57 million Uber customers.
    That is called extortion. This breach may change laws as senators are now looking
	to make covering up breaches a crime.

13. Wikileaks and Vault 7

14. Cloudbleed

15. France Macron Leak

16.
