## Individual First Aid Kit

The individual first aid kit or IFAK is a small medical bag designed to carry
life saving equipment. It is normally man portable, simple, and specialized.
The purpose of carrying an IFAK is to provide life saving care while awaiting
arrival of an ambulance for advanced treatment and transportation to better
facilities. In general, if you need to open your IFAK, you will be in need of
ambulance transportation and further care. I do not carry or provide others
with things like medications, bandaides, or cut and scrape care. My IFAK is
purpose built to provide care in the event of a traumatic injury.

I do not carry medications, antibiotics, nasal trumpets, or the tools necessary
to provide care for a collapsed lung. I may include some of these tools if I
get the opportunity to retrain on them again.

## My Bag
![My First Aid Kit][fullbag]

Purchase this bag on [Amazon.][amazonorcabag]

My bag is an Orca Tactical MOLLE Rip-Away EMT Medical First Aid Blowout Pouch
and is Coyote colored. I decided to not use a bedazzler on the bag but instead
opted to add three simple patches. The first patch is my 'Regular Guy' tab
which I thought was fun. The next was my 0+ blood type patch. Any medical
facility is going to provide saline and then O+ or O- blood until they can
ascertain your blood type but it is a nice patch and matches the motif. Yes, as
per the American Red Cross, my blood type is O+. Finally, I added a Christian
Cross in red and tan.

The major benefit of this bag is that it is MOLLE compatible and has a tear
away hook and loop back so it can be easily removed from my gear for use.

## Bag Contents
![Open Bag][openbag]

The bag itself is easy to open. The zippers span the majority of the bag sides
and it lays flat very easily. It gives quick access to the majority of the
contents without you needing to poke around and look for things. The most
important items are your gloves and the tourniquets. They are easy to reach and
front and center.

### Bandages

![Z Pak Wound Dressing][zpak]

![Adventure Medical Clotting Sponge][clottingsponge]

You may need to pack or wrap a wound. You can use clothing and other cloth as a
temporary bandage but items like the adventure medical sponge are impregnated
with compounds like QuickClot that aid in the clotting process. I believe that
having easily accessed bandages and sponges is more effective than trying to
improvise medical supplies from potentially compromised materials. 

### Tourniquet
![CAT Tourniquet][tournqt]

The Comabt-Application-Tourniquet is a highly effective tool in stopping
bleeding in an emergency. They are often referred to as CAT tourniquets. Many
preventable deaths are caused by unrestricted bleeding of the extremities. This
can be caused by partial or full amputations, slashing, or even penetrating
wounds. Gun shots, car accidents, and stabbings are all potential mechanisms of
injury that could require a tourniquet.

### Scissors
![Scissor Leash][scisleash]

Scissors are useful for removing clothing, cutting straps, or trimming
bandages. They are multifaceted and very useful. Don't skimp on your cutting
device. I also have a leash for the scissors so they don't drop, fall, or get
lost. If I have my hands on my bag, I should not loose my scissors.

### Celox

</div>

Celox granules are used for packing wounds that cannot be treated with the
application of a tourniquet. This could include the pelvis, arm pits, or
otherwise. I chose Celox because it does not have any heat generating
properties. It will assist in clotting and stop severe bleeding but can be
easily washed out of the wound after the casualty is handed off to advanced
medical care.

### Gloves
![Single Glove Pair][indglove]
![Bag of ten pairs of gloves][pkgloves]

I always carry gloves. I have an individual package of gloves in a sealed bag
as well as ten extra pairs of gloves in a small black carry satchel. I can pass
out some of these gloves for others who are helping if needed. You can never
have too many pairs of safety gloves.

### Misc
![Roll Of Duct Tape][ducttape]

I carry duct tape for several reasons. It can be used to hold bandages, add
security to tourniquet clasps, or as a writing surface that can be stuck to a
person. I use a small duct tape roll that has been squished and is held within
an elastic strap inside the bag. You can also use a lighter as a base for the
duct tape. Wrap duct tape around the body of the lighter to give yourself a
combination of duct tape as well as a fire source if necessary.
