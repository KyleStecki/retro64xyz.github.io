## Introduction

Greetings from the past, this is the retro64XYZ podcast. On this episode of the
podcast, we will be discussing chiptunes, gpg encryption, and the NSA. 

### Chiptunes

I love chiptunes and I hope you will enjoy them too. Check out
[Ozzed](http://ozzed.net/) and some of the music he is making.

### GPG Encryption

Need crypto? Take a look at what the folks at [keybase](https://keybase.io) are
doing!

### The NSA

Will this wild ride ever end? Probably not. Stay safe out there and go Linux! 

## Thank You For Listening

Thank you for listening to the retro64xyz podcast. Catch us next time when we
