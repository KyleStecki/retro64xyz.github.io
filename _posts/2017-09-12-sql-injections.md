summary: >
  Introduction To Defensive Programming is a two hour course focused on
  developing the skills necessary to understand best practices for software
  development. SQL injection is a serious flaw that is found in many pieces of
  software. This course focuses on developing the skills necessary to
  understand how SQL is implemented, commond mistakes and flaws, and methods to
  prevent common issues.

## Performance Objective

At the conclusion of the course the student will be able to:

1. Identify the five most popular data base engines.
2. Identify two ways that data base engines can differ.
3. Identify what SQL injection is.
4. Identify one tool used in PHP to prevent SQL injection.
5. 

## Introduction

Software development and security are intertwined concepts. Your hardware is

## Servers

The most popular SQL servers are -

1. Oracle
2. MySQL
3. Microsoft SQL Server
4. PostgreSQL
5. IBM DB2

It is very important that you figure out which server is being employed by your
target. This should be one of your top goals as you begin the process of
executing an attack. Each server will have both minor as well as major
differences in syntax and function that will require specific changers in
behavior when attempting to exploit flaws.

## Risks

SQL injection is a code injection technique that can be used to cause unwanted
behavior in your application. Some of the results of an SQL injection attack
include the following -

1. Destruction of data.
2. Breach of privacy.
3. Access control loss.

## Vulnerable Software

The majority of software is built on tight deadlines with limited budget and
low security related experience. Many companies follow a specific type of
development process in which they will attempt to make a deployable product
with the least amount of effort and then work to iterate towards bug fixes,
security fixes, and improvements as they have time and energy to do so. If the
product fails, then they will scrap the project and start again or move on to
something else.

The effort needed to create safe and security software is rarely considered a
top priority and any company that does take the time to develop secure software
should be praised for their progressive and strange thinking in the current
landscape.


## Answers

1. Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL, PostreSQL, and IBM DB2 are the five most
   popular data base engines.

2. Query Syntax and Stored Function/Procs Language Choice are two ways they
   differ.

3. SQL Injection is the result of running unvalidated SQL queries through an
   application by the use of exploits or with the help of poorly designed
   interfaces.

4. Prepared statements or parametrized queries can help defend against SQL
   injection.

## Conclusion

Software development skills are invaluable for security researchers, network

## Final Recommendations

1. Use Linux!
