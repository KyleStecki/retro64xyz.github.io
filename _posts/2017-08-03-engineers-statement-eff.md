I was invited to [read, review, and sign an EFF statement][EFFStatementURL]{:target="_blank"} on
the technical flaws in the FCC notice of proposed rule-making that would work
towards closing the internet off. I did sign the document as I feel that a more
open internet is important. Broadband service providers should not be allowed
to dictate what information you or I have access to on the internet.
